📌 Volcano Plot - Understanding the Visualization
A Volcano Plot is a scatter plot used to visualize differential expression in genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics studies.

🛠️ Plot Axes
X-axis (Log2 Fold Change): Shows the magnitude of change between conditions.
Y-axis (-log10 P-value): Represents statistical significance.
🔍 How to Interpret?
Upregulated Genes (High Log2FC & Low P-value): Top-right of the plot.
Downregulated Genes (Low Log2FC & Low P-value): Top-left of the plot.
Non-significant Genes: Found near the center and bottom of the plot.
