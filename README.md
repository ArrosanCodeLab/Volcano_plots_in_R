# **📌 Volcano Plot - Understanding the Visualization**

A **Volcano Plot** is a scatter plot used to visualize **differential expression** in genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics studies. It helps identify significantly upregulated and downregulated genes based on statistical significance and fold change.

## **🛠️ Plot Axes**
- **X-axis (Log2 Fold Change):** Represents the magnitude of change between conditions.
- **Y-axis (-log10 P-value):** Represents statistical significance, where higher values indicate more significant results.

---

## **🔍 How to Interpret?**
- **⬆️ Upregulated Genes:** (High Log2FC & Low P-value) → Located at the **top-right** of the plot.
- **⬇️ Downregulated Genes:** (Low Log2FC & Low P-value) → Located at the **top-left** of the plot.
- **⚪ Non-significant Genes:** (Low significance) → Found near the **center and bottom** of the plot.

## **📊 Example Volcano Plot**
You can generate a Volcano Plot using **R 

To use the Volcano Plot, the following packages should be installed in your R environment.
If these packages are not installed, use the following code to install them:

install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")

``r
